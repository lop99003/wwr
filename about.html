                    Creed: "Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is
                    that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee." - Deuteronomy 6:31 Motto: "Let's paddle
                    away from our problems and into the adventure!" - Unknown.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>White water rafting began in the early 1800s, 1811. This was when it was recorded a crew's trip on
                the Snake River. After that trip, it was agreed that they were not prepared to navigate through the
                river, and the Snake River then after was referred to as "The Mad River." Our family members were on
                that trip, and thus began our company history.
